# Edge_Variance

This repository accompanies the paper "Efficient Construction of Thermostable Lipase A Mutants Assisted by Protein Contact Network Community Clustering".

It includes relevant molecular dynamics simulation configuration files and sampling data, as well as the code for constructing protein interaction networks and conducting edge variance analysis. The analysis is implemented through Jupyter Notebook.
